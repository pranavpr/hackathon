India Rising
=============

This applicaton is being developed as hackathon organized by [The Ugly Indian](http://theuglyindian.com) and [community](https://www.facebook.com/theugl.yindian). 

###Requirements


- You can build either a mobile or a web application. There are no restrictions on the platform you can build. All we care about is that whatever you build works, is easy to use and has the potential to have mass appeal.

The primary functional requirements for the app include
- **Planning a spot fix** | Any person who is interested to do a spot fix should be able to upload a photo, location and description of the spot along with a planned date she or he intends to fix it on.
- **Joining a spot fix** | Any person should be able to browse through planned spot fixes in their vicinity and be able to join the spotfix and share the fix across social media.
- **Reporting a spot fix** | Any person should be able to report a spot fix after it has been completed. The user should be able to upload a before/after picture, a geotagged location, a date and a description of the fix.
- **Map based dashboard** | The primary interface should be map based that shows spots that are available for a fix and spots that have been fixed. The dashboard should let users navigate to each of the spots and browse the details. The dashboard should also report metrics like - Total number of hours volunteered, total number of spot fixes and other interesting aggregated metrics.

###Status so far

- **Planning a spot fix** \- Users can plan a hot fix and submit the same
- **Joining a spot fix** \- Work in progress
- **Reporting a spot fix** \- Users can report a hot fix. They can submit after poto and description.
